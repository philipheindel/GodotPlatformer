# GodotPlatformer
This is just a simple platformer so I can learn Godot 4.

## Engine
For the engine I am using [Godot 4](https://godotengine.org/).

## Assets
For the visual assets I am using a customized version of the [Pixel Platformer](https://kenney.nl/assets/pixel-platformer) pack from [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/) that has been split into multiple sheets and rearranged.

## Purpose
Initially I had planned to make this it's own self contained project, but I think I will shift it to be more of a template project. Though, as I get more familiar with the engine, that plan might change.
